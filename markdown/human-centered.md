It struck me recently that the idea of "human-centered" work manifests in many
different fields, including but not limited to software engineering.

As a software engineer, the term "user-centered design" (UCD) comes up often. It was
[conveyed to me](https://methods.18f.gov/) most clearly during my brief stint in government, but I recall
hearing it sporadically across various channels in the past. Though
it seems like most software organizations have their own definition, I think there is a common,
albeit somewhat abstract, thread: _actively_ involve your users in the design process. In practice,
this could mean iterating on a software design based on user feedback before passing it off to the
engineering team. It may even mean that users act as the designers, sketching up
or describing verbally what they want from their software.

## {Patient | citizen}-centered

Recently, though, I came across this idea in two other contexts: medicine and policy-making. In medicine,
there exists the notion of _patient-centered care_ (PCC), and its core idea is strikingly similar to that of UCD:
provide medical care that reflects the diverse needs and lived experiences of each patient
([source](https://online.lasalle.edu/articles/rnbsn/what-is-patient-centered-care.aspx)). In
other words, medical providers can improve the quality of their care by being cognizant of the
idiosyncrasies of their patient populations. To me, this feels decidedly intuitive. When I go to
the doctor, I want to be treated as an individual, not an appointment. I want -- and indeed demand -- the
type of care I receive to be as personalized as possible. Things are not terribly different for
users of software and, unsurprisingly, those affected by policy.

In a [recent edition of _Issues_ magazine](https://issues.org/thinking-like-citizen-participatory-technology-assessment-weller-govani-farooque/),
a group of authors argued for the benefits of pTA (participatory technology assessment), a process in which
experts, politicians, and citizens come
together to have organized conversation around pressing policy issues. This
model differs from a typical town hall by, as noted in the article, providing
space for _all_ citizens to share their thoughts, as opposed to "a few bold
participants" who often dominate the discussion. The effectiveness of pTA comes
from its belief that the true "experts" are those affected by policy, not those
who create it. In other words, pTA is a citizen-centered
approach to policymaking! I can't think of a better approach for governments
to make decisions, and I'm hoping we see similar innovations as our government
attempts to tackle things like climate change, anti-trust, and economic
inequality.

## Implications

Regardless of your field of work, I'd suggest you ask yourself: **How do the people I build for
-- with all their experiences, feelings, and ideas -- figure in to my day-to-day work?** If you can't clearly
answer this question, work backwards; put yourself in their shoes instead.
How much do you interact with the people providing you X good or service?

In the US's capitalist economy, it seems all too easy (at companies, at least) to focus
entirely on your unique tasks, devoid of larger context or
communication with the people you serve. If more of us took a rigorous
human-centered approach, not only would we do more impactful work, but
we'd probably be more motivated, too.
