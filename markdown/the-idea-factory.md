# The Idea Factory

This was a phenomenal book on innovation writ-large, but on engineering
organization in particular. Bell Labs was arguably the _premier_ research
laboratory of the 20th century, churning out new technologies at a prolific rate.

Still, the most interesting aspects of Bell Labs, in my mind, lie in the
_processes_ that begat the inventions, the philosophies and practices the
Labs and its leaders cultivated which enabled it to be so effective. Certain
ways of working, including intentionally-open floor plans,
self-organized study groups, and a deep commitment to **bounded** research
exploration, led directly to the organization's robustness.

In today's innovation-obsessed world, it is prudent to step back and deconstruct
the very process of innovation, particularly given that we as a society are confronting the seemingly-insurmountable problem
of climate change. If we are to tackle this "wicked problem," we will absolutely
need a renewed commitment to research aimed at solving long-term,
humanity-driven problems, rather than short-term, market-driven ones. All in all, _The Idea Factory_ is really a story
about collaboration: how a diversity of perspectives (though Bell Labs was certainly not diverse in many
other, important ways) and a shared understanding of purpose can create a
collective research output which is veritably greater than the sum of its parts.

**Note:** For a proper book review, I'd check out [Walter Isaacson's](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/books/review/the-idea-factory-by-jon-gertner.html) entry in the New York Times. And for a wonderful visualization of the plethora of Bell Labs inventions, see [this graphic](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/02/26/sunday-review/26bell-gfx.html).
