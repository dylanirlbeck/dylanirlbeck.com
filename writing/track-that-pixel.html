      <p>
        Last week, I went down the rabbit hole of one particularly deceptive web
        tracking technology:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon"
          >the tracking pixel ("web beacon")</a
        >. It is shocking how many websites employ things like the Meta Pixel to
        harvest data from users without their knowledge -- and in industries
        where the practice is possibly even illegal based on existing law.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build up my mental model of how tracking pixels work (and maintain
        some degree of coding proficiency), I wanted to write a minimal program
        to simulate the basics of this technology. The result is
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/track-that-pixel"
          ><code>track-that-pixel</code></a
        >, the code for which you can find open-sourced on my GitHub.

        A tracking pixel (also known as “web beacon”) is a visually-unnoticeable
        bit of information included in an HTML document that, when loaded by a
        client, will send information to a third-party server. This type of
        document could hypothetically appear anywhere on the web, but the most
        common formats are webpages and email content. A notable implementation
        of this technology is the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/"
          >Meta Pixel</a
        >
        (<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel"
          >developer docs</a
        >): a small piece of code that any website owner can utilize to track
        user data and improve their targeted advertising across Meta's
        platforms.

        Researchers at groups like the Markup and Adalytics have reported on
        several surreptitious — and possibly illegal — uses of the tracking
        pixel in the domains of
        <a
          href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook"
          >tax preparation software</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites"
          >medical care</a
        >, and
        <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/is-congress-leaking-your-data"
          >U.S. politicians’ personal websites</a
        >. Unlike many industries, tax, medicine, and politics are
        highly-regulated, with existing laws on the books specifically to
        protect privacy. (In fact, Senators Warren, Wyden, and others
        <a
          href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/in-new-report-senators-warren-wyden-lawmakers-reveal-massive-likely-illegal-breach-of-taxpayer-privacy-by-tax-prep-companies-with-meta_call-for-agencies-to-investigate-prosecute"
          >recently recommended</a
        >
        that several federal agencies, including the Dept. of Justice,
        investigate these privacy violations and prosecute any company that
        violated the law.)
      </p>
      <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Implement a minimally-viable tracking pixel to illustrate the ease with
        which sites can compromise user privacy (intentionally
        <strong><em>and</em></strong> unintentionally).
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, consumers ought to be aware of this basic tracking
        technology and how it negatively impacts their overall privacy across
        the web. And developers ought to exercise judgement — and abide by the
        law, depending on the industry — when incorporating this tracking on
        websites they build.
