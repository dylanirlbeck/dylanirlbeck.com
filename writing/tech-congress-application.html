        <a href="https://www.techcongress.io/">TechCongress</a>, a program which
        places technologists on Capitol Hill to advise on technology policy,
        fundamentally changed the course of my career. Like many other
        high-quality programs, however, it is competitive, and the success of an
        application depends heavily on the responses given to several
        short-answer questions.

        When I was preparing my application materials, particularly the policy
        memo, I faced significant writers block. One of the things that helped
        me get unstuck was a
        <a
          href="https://posts.bcavello.com/techcongress-2021-application-answers"
          >blog post from B Cavello</a
        >, in which they shared the responses that led to an acceptance into the
        program.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this post, I'm also going to share the core of my application, in
        the hopes that it provides some inspiration to future applicants and
        helps de-mystify the process. As always, if you're seriously considering
        TechCongress and would like to chat with me directly,

        As a student, I studied the theory underpinning our digital world. And
        between semesters, I contributed to that world, building mobile and web
        applications, Internet-of-Things devices, and open-source projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the General Services Administration, I learned how to engage with
        users, before writing code. I fostered trust with stakeholders by
        playing translator, unpacking technical jargon and, in the other
        direction, writing software according to described needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I doubled down on this human-centered approach at Flexport. I
        prioritized careful design: shadowing users, gathering requirements, and
        writing plain-term proposals. I observed the impact that clear technical
        communication could have; in turn, I discussed our software systems in
        memos, talks, and blog posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Congress, I aim to craft policy that is informed and needs-driven
        while ensuring alignment with every collaborator, regardless of their
        technical ability. All my strengths and experiences will, I believe,
        make me an intensely curious, collaborative, and effective Fellow.

        SUBJECT: Stimulating federal diligence and investment in open-source
        software
      </p>
      <p>
        BACKGROUND Our modern economy is buoyed by the work of volunteer
        programmers. These volunteers write publicly available, free code (known
        as “open-source software”) that over 97% of businesses depend on. This
        software fulfills critical needs common to every business and industry:
        things like operating systems, programming languages, and machine
        learning tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of open-source software in our digital economy is akin to that
        of roads and bridges in our physical economy: it forms the
        infrastructure upon which all businesses operate. However, there is a
        key difference. Physical infrastructure is largely built and managed by
        the government, while digital infrastructure is built and managed
        principally by self-organized groups and individuals (known as
        “maintainers”). ISSUE The decentralized nature of open-source software
        production and utilization presents considerable risks to our nation’s
        security and economy. Indeed, recent vulnerabilities in ubiquitous
        open-source projects – like the “Heartbleed Bug” in 2014 and the
        Log4Shell exploit in 2021 – have threatened user safety and privacy,
        compromised critical data, and wrought substantial costs to governments
        and businesses. And due to the interdependencies between open-source
        software, the “blast radius” of a vulnerability can be both massive and
        unpredictable. Moreover, attacks on the open-source ecosystem – not
        including vulnerabilities introduced unknowingly by maintainers – have
        increased by 742% over the past three years. In the absence of a
        coordinated, public-private plan to secure open-source software, these
        risks will continue to fester.
      </p>
      <p>RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Advocate for the passage of the Securing Open Source Software Act, an
          unprecedented bill that secures the federal government’s use of
          open-source software and formalizes the role of the Cybersecurity
          &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency in matters of open-source.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an open-source program office within the Department of Homeland
          Security (DHS). Open source ought to be a central focus of DHS’s
          cybersecurity strategy, and they need the ability to respond
          dynamically to new threats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Propose a “Federal Open Source Policy Challenge” that brings
          government experts and open source practitioners together to devise a
          long-term, collaborative approach to open source security and
          innovation in the U.S.

      <p>
        When I began studying computer science, I felt that our nation’s biggest
        problems could be solved with apps and algorithms. After working at
        several companies, I concluded that software is indeed a tool with the
        capacity to effect change, but it is so often abused.
      </p>
      <p>
        In public interest technology (PIT), I observed that same tool wielded
        for good. My foray into PIT led me to technology policy as another lever
        arm for change, one that could act as both guardrails and lubricant for
        technology deployment that actually improves lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then found TechCongress, and I saw in its fellowships the door to the
        policy world that I was searching for. As I pursue a career in PIT, I
        want to be fluent as a technologist and policymaker, combining these
        disciplines to drive technology innovation in the public interest.
        Serving as a Fellow now is vital to achieving my policy ambitions.
