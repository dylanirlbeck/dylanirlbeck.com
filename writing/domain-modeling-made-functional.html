      <h1>Notes on <i>Domain Modeling Made Functional</i></h1>
      <p>
        I’ll divide my notes from <i>Domain Modeling Made Functional</i> into
        four main sections: fundamentals of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"
          >domain-driven design</a
        >; functional architectures; domain modeling; and high-level takeaways.
        I’ll include page numbers where applicable in case you’ve purchased the
        book and want to use these notes as a reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I greatly enjoyed this book, and I’d likely advocate for using
        its guidance if I become an architect of an enterprise software project
        in the future. In practice, I plan to use its guidance on domain
        modeling quite heavily: I want to understand the domain of freight
        forwarding (and specifically, warehousing) deeply enough such that I can
        model the core components effectively in software. In addition, I will
        continue to look for ways to apply the principles of functional
        programming (particularly around designing programs as pipleines)
        despite my usage of object-oriented languages in my day-to-day (Ruby,
        JavaScript, and Java).

          Fundamental components of DDD (p. 22)
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Bounded contexts</em>: subsystems with clear boundaries, each
              of which own their data stores. These systems consist of
              workflows, and each has its own contextual language.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Domain events</em>: generated via techniques such as
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming"
                >event storming</a
              >

            <li>
              <em>Ubiquitous</em>: a language with nouns — data structures — and
              verbs — business processes — that is shared between all
              stakeholders in a project. These terms should be maintained in a
              <strong>living</strong> document.

        <li>
          What are the main components of a functional architecture? (pp. 43-55)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Bounded contexts as autonomus subsystems with well-defined [data]
              boundaries. These contexts could be <em>implemented</em> in a
              variety of ways, depending on the scale of the system.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Could be simple software modules/classes, separate
                  network-isolated services, or even microservices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In general: start with a monolith and refactor into services
                  at sufficient scale.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Components stay decoupled when communicating (via events/message
              queues), or simple function calls
            </li>
            <li>
              Contracts between bounded contexts is a hard concept to get right,
              but incredibly important (p. 48)

              Code structure within a bounded context:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="domainmodeling">Domain modeling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The idea of documentation as <em>compilable</em> code — i.e. types —
          is the central to domain modeling. (p. 57)
        </li>
        <li>
          Type patterns (p. 78)
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Simple values</em> (e.g. identifiers, messages). These values
              are often constrained in the domain. For example, if there are
              only 100 products in a catalog, an integer-based product code
              could only go up to 100.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>AND combinations</em>. These types represent closely linked
              data (i.e. documents), and are implemented with records.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Choices with OR</em>. Represents a choice between this
              <em>or</em> that.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Workflows</em>. Business processes with well-defined inputs
              and outputs. Often, these workflows cause side effects. (Workflows
              correspond to functions.)
            </li>

          for classifying data(p. 88)
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Value Objects</em>: objects <strong>without</strong> a
              persistent identity. For instance, if the fact that the fields of
              two objects are the same means the “value” of those objects are
              the same, you’re dealing with value objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Entity</em>: objects <strong>with</strong> a persistent
              identity. Often, these objects are documents of some kind. They
              have a unique identity even if their components (fields) change.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Aggregate</em>: collection of entities, where the top-level
              entity is called the <em>aggregate root.</em> Aggregates enforce
              consistency and invariants in the domain: if an entity in its
              collection changes, it will reflect those changes across other
              associated entites in the domain.

              will get the system to the state we expect in spite of transient
              failures.

              Data is passed from one function to another, in the form of a
              pipeline. (And more concretely, using the pipeline operator in
              FP.)

              State machines in particular can be highly useful for modeling
              workflows.

        <li>Idea: documenting side effects in function type signatures.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          F# is a great language for DDD: it has useful primitives such as
          algebraic data types, modules, map/bind methods, Result/Async type
          wrappers, and computation expressions.
          <ul>
            <li>
              I don’t believe that the third section of the book in particular,
              since it was so implementation-heavy, is immediately useful to
              most developers if there is already lots of code in a
              <em>different</em> language. (Perhaps if the existing language is
              part of the JVM, though, this assertion might not hold.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I like to think of domain types as an <em>instantiation</em> of the
          ubiquitious language.
          <ul>
            <li>
              However, I don’t think this book dove as deep into requirements
              gathering as I would have liked. Without understanding the domain,
              you can’t attempt to domain model.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          With rigorous and intentional domain modeling, I can’t imagine the
          design getting out-of-sync with the code <em>nor</em> the real world
          requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pushing input/output to the boundaries of a workflow/application can
          make business logic significantly easier to reason about. More
          practically, I think this pattern can be implemented in simple method
          calls as well: push logs, jobs, etc. to the very end of void
          (unit-returning) methods to make it crystal-clear where the side
          effects are occuring. Burying logs or other side effects in helper
          functions can make a system’s behavior incrementally more difficult to
          reason through (not to mention harder to test).
