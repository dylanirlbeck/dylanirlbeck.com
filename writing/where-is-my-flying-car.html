      <h1>Notes on <i>Where Is My Flying Car?</i></h1>
      <p>
        In <em>Where Is My Flying Car?</em> J. Storrs Hall, a computer scientist
        and futurist, gives his explanation for why one of the most iconic
        science fiction ideas — a flying car — is not yet ubiquitous in our
        society. When I picked up the book, I almost surely thought the answer
        to the titular question was an absence of requisite technological
        advances; in other words, I believe that our tech simply wasn’t good
        enough. But Hall’s argument convinced me otherwise: we could easily have
        had flying cars by now. In fact, as he points out, we have already seen
        iterations of flying cars in helicopters and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyro">autogyros</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Hall gives many reasons to explain this technological
        stagnation, the most salient — or perhaps striking — one is surely that
        our collective motivation to do great and difficult things (as we saw
        from the start of the Industrial Revolution through the postwar period
        of the 20th century) has greatly diminished. This effect has been, in
        Hall’s eyes, both active and passive. It has been active insofar as the
        government has implemented innovation-unfriendly regulation and
        activists, especially those concerned about climate change, have stymied
        the development of cheap energy sources like nuclear. It has been
        passive to the extent that more smart people than ever before are
        <strong>not</strong> endeavoring to do great work, instead going into
        fields like law, finance, or the “ivory tower” of academia.

        As someone interested in the possibilities of technology policy, this
        book provided an interesting — and I’d guess unpopular — perspective on
        a number of policy-adjacent issues. It also left me inspired to build.
        After explaining our past and present, Hall describes a future in which
        the worldwide standard of living jumps by another order of magnitude, a
        second Industrial Revolution of sorts. I want to contribute to that
        world, and so should you.

        The three parts in Hall’s book are Profiles of the Past, Profiles of the
        Present, and Profiles of the Future. I’ll include my rough notes on each
        part in the following section:

          Hall is advocating for a new Industrial Revolution that improves the
          lives of ordinary people by an order of magnitude.
        </li>
        <li>
          Robots that can totally understand human behavior and ethics, in a way
          that GPT-3 cannot (Hall refers to GPT as nothing but a “glib pastiche”
          of all the information on the web).
        </li>
        <li>
          The “Second Atomic Age”: nanotech and nuclear energy (fission,
          hot/cold fusion) will work synergistically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flying cars that, unlike helicopters or gyros, can take off from your
          driveway and achieve airliner speeds (effectively a “private
          spaceship”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Human society desperately needs a space frontier to “pit ourselves
          against the universe.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Innovation in cities: taller buildings (miles-high), multileveled
          streets, seagoing cities, airborne villages, and more. Hall captures
          the essence of a city with a great quote: “[Cities] should be machines
          for facilitating commerce and social interactions.”
        </li>
        <li>
          World weather control, such as having automated mirrors that reflect,
          deflect, or capture sunlight as it hits the Earth. More generally,
          Hall describes just how much energy lies uncaptured in our galaxy and
          universe.
