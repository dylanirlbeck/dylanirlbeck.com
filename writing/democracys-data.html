        <p>
          In <i>Democracy’s Data</i>, Dan Bouk uses the 1940 U.S. Census as a
          case study for reading into the “depths” of data. These depths include
          the data’s designers: those who decide what information to collect,
          what not to collect, and from whom to collect. The depths include the
          process through which a data set is produced: the mechanisms — people,
          paper forms, digital interfaces — by which data is inputted and,
          potentially, the unseen pressures imposed upon the dataset by
          political and social forces. The depths of data, moreover, include the
          choice of how to present the data and how those presentations are
          manipulated, utilized, and challenged. And the depths are rife with
          “silences,” important gaps in the data elided — maybe intentionally,
          maybe not — in its presentation. But above all, the depths of data, at
          every layer, are filled with hidden stories, waiting patiently to be
          read.

          Within this framework, Bouk unpacks the 1940 U.S. Census, piece by

          <li>
            Designers: government bureacrats from several federal agencies,
            statisticians and academics, special invitees of President
            Roosevelt’s adminstration, and business interests (including the
            life insurance, retail, and manufacturing industries). Importantly,
            this cadre of designers consisted almost exclusively of white men.

            Process: enumerators (commonly called “census takers”), often
            selected via state-level political patronage, would

            from door to door across their assigned “enumeration districts.”
            They were seeking to locate and interview the heads of households:
            the fundamental organizational unit of the census. These enumerators
            would record street addresses, names, races, education and income
            levels, occupations, and, as Bouk specifically expands on in his
            chapter on “partners,” the relation between the head of household
            and each individual residing in said household. Based on the
            political and social inclincations of each enumerator, and their
            interpretation of census guidelines, the attributes recorded in the
            form may or may not have aligned with the will of the person being
            counted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Presentation: the most fundamental output of the census is a number.
            For the 1940 Census, that number was 131,669,275: the official size
            of the U.S. population. Also included in the Census Bureau’s report
            was reapportionment data. After all, the entire thesis for the
            census is that the number of House representatives and federal
            spending ought to remain proportional to state population sizes.
            While the presentation of high-level census data happens within a
            few years after the count concluded, more granular statistics are,

            >, sealed for a period of 72 years, ostensibly to protect the
            privacy of those counted. But despite the Census Bureau’s stated
            commitment to privacy, the political pressures of World War II
            proved too great for the Bureau: in an effort to make themselves
            useful, Bouk recounts how the Bureau eagerly aided the military’s
            efforts to round up Japaenese Americans for internment early on in
            the war.

            Silences: the story of America and its development is undeniably a
            story of white supremacy, and the census did not escape this racism.
            With the help of a census statistician, a
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1497788/"
              >major (and deeply flawed!) work of scientific racism</a
            >
            was published that, using 1890 census data that showed the rate of
            growth in the Black population dramatically fall off, surmised that
            federal aid ought not to be provided to a populace which was
            trending towards “extinction.” As it turns out, there were systemic
            undercounts of the Black population in several censuses; the Census
            Bureau, however, was fiercely resistant to the Black professor —
            Kelly Miller — who first made the undercount claim. Without a
            deeper, intentional reading of data for silences, large swathes of
            Black people would have remained unrepresented in the so-called
            “inventory of democracy.”

            Stories: perhaps the most striking aspect of
            <i>Democracy’s Data</i> were the rich, individual stories.
            Enumerators, the enumerated, specific “Question Men”, senators,
            Census Bureau statisticians (and the family of one Japanese staff
            member), and even Bouk’s own immediate and extended family. Reading
            through these stories made me want to dig through census records to
            see who I might discover; I specifically thought about looking for
            my family in the data. Indeed, one of my fellow Coding it Forward
            fellows went down this very route,

        </ul>
        <p>
          All in all, <i>Democracy’s Data</i> was an engaging crash course in
          how to critically read data, and I’d highly recommend it for anyone
          who collects, analyzes, or operates on data.
