      <h1>Notes on <i>The Idea Factory</i></h1>
      <p>
        <em>The Idea Factory</em>, by Jon Gertner, was a phenomenal book on
        innovation writ large, and on engineering organization in particular.
        Bell Labs was arguably the <em>premier</em> research laboratory of the
        20th century, churning out new technologies at a prolific rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, the most interesting aspects of Bell Labs, in my mind, lie in the
        <em>processes</em> that begat the inventions, the philosophies and
        practices the Labs and its leaders cultivated which enabled it to be so
        effective. Certain ways of working, including intentionally-open floor
        plans, self-organized study groups, and a deep commitment to
        <strong>bounded</strong> research exploration, led directly to the
        organization's robustness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's innovation-obsessed world, it is prudent to step back and
        deconstruct the very process of innovation, particularly given that we
        as a society are confronting the seemingly-insurmountable problem of
        climate change. If we are to tackle this "wicked problem," we will
        absolutely need a renewed commitment to research aimed at solving
        long-term, humanity-driven problems, rather than short-term,
        market-driven ones. All in all,
        <em>The Idea Factory</em> is really a story about collaboration: how a
        diversity of perspectives (though Bell Labs was certainly not diverse in
        many other, important ways) and a shared understanding of purpose can
        create a collective research output which is veritably greater than the
        sum of its parts.
