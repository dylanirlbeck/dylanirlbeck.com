          It struck me recently that the idea of "human-centered" work manifests
          in many different fields, including but not limited to software
          engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, the term "user-centered design" (UCD) comes up
          often. It was
          <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/">conveyed to me</a> most clearly
          during my brief stint in government, but I recall hearing it
          sporadically across various channels in the past. Though it seems like
          most software organizations have their own definition, I think there
          is a common, albeit somewhat abstract, thread:
          <em>actively</em> involve your users in the design process. In
          practice, this could mean iterating on a software design based on user
          feedback before passing it off to the engineering team. It may even
          mean that users act as the designers, sketching up or describing
          verbally what they want from their software.
        </p>

          Recently, though, I came across this idea in two other contexts:
          medicine and policy-making. In medicine, there exists the notion of
          <em>patient-centered care</em> (PCC), and its core idea is strikingly
          similar to that of UCD: provide medical care that reflects the diverse
          needs and lived experiences of each patient (<a
            href="https://online.lasalle.edu/articles/rnbsn/what-is-patient-centered-care.aspx"
            >source</a
          >). In other words, medical providers can improve the quality of their
          care by being cognizant of the idiosyncrasies of their patient
          populations. To me, this feels decidedly intuitive. When I go to the
          doctor, I want to be treated as an individual, not an appointment. I
          want -- and indeed demand -- the type of care I receive to be as
          personalized as possible. Things are not terribly different for users
          of software and, unsurprisingly, those affected by policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a
          <a
            href="https://issues.org/thinking-like-citizen-participatory-technology-assessment-weller-govani-farooque/"
            >recent edition of <em>Issues</em> magazine</a
          >, a group of authors argued for the benefits of pTA (participatory
          technology assessment), a process in which experts, politicians, and
          citizens come together to have organized conversation around pressing
          policy issues. This model differs from a typical town hall by, as
          noted in the article, providing space for <em>all</em> citizens to
          share their thoughts, as opposed to "a few bold participants" who
          often dominate the discussion. The effectiveness of pTA comes from its
          belief that the true "experts" are those affected by policy, not those
          who create it. In other words, pTA is a citizen-centered approach to
          policymaking! I can't think of a better approach for governments to
          make decisions, and I'm hoping we see similar innovations as our
          government attempts to tackle things like climate change, anti-trust,
          and economic inequality.

        <p>
          Regardless of your field of work, I'd suggest you ask yourself:
          <b
            >How do the people I build for -- with all their experiences,
            feelings, and ideas -- figure in to my day-to-day work?</b
          >
          If you can't clearly answer this question, work backwards; put
          yourself in their shoes instead. How much do you interact with the
          people providing you X good or service?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the US's capitalist economy, it seems all too easy (at companies,
          at least) to focus entirely on your unique tasks, devoid of larger
          context or communication with the people you serve. If more of us took
          a rigorous human-centered approach, not only would we do more
          impactful work, but we'd probably be more motivated, too.
