      <p>
        There exists a large class of functions which can “fail.” For
        side-effect-producing functions, loud failures may arise when performing
        I/O like database reads and writes, gRPC calls to external services, or
        publishing to an event log. But even simple, pure code may fail. For
        example, suppose we want to write a function for updating two different
        dates — X and Y — on a domain object, and we have a rule that X
        <em>must</em> always precede Y (the function should return a new
        instance of the domain object). If a caller attempts to pass in a date
        for Y that comes before X, what value should we return? One construct
        afforded by most languages,

        above. Is there another pattern we can use as the return value for
        functions that can fail?

        This post is the first in a series on error handling in Ruby. In it, I
        attempt to explore how
        <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Exception.html">exceptions</a>,
        result monad patterns (like those present in languages like
        <a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/api/Result.html">OCaml</a> and
        <a
          href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results"
          >F#</a
        >), and <a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a>, a static type system,
        might be combined to create a coherent approach to error handling in
        Ruby.
      </p>

        Error handling poses a challenge to the reasonability of digital systems
        in general: if errors -- both expected and unexpected -- are not handled
        consistently and explicitly, developers will have a difficult time
        predicting system behavior with confidence. To this end, I'll aim to
        call out any learnings I have vis-a-vis error handling which apply
        outside of Ruby.
