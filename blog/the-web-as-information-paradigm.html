          The following essay was my term paper for
          <a href="https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys419/sp2021/"
            >Physics/Philosophy 419: Space, Time, & Matter</a
          >, taught at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign by Professor
          Philip Phillips. I took the course as a senior in Spring 2021.

          As one of the few significant essays I've written (I graduated with a
          B.S. in Computer Science, so we didn't write in English all that
          often), there will likely be bugs. Any spelling or grammatical errors,
          stylistic inconsistencies, or citation issues are not intentional and
          I would love for you to make me aware of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I wrote this essay without having completed
          <em>Weaving the Web</em> by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. After reading
          firsthand his ideas about the web's inception and evolving goals, I
          would probably have reworded the Normal Science section in particular,
          and minor other sentences of the essay in general. Either way, I
          wanted this blog to contain the term paper in its original form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logistics and reflections aside, this essay argues that the World Wide
          Web, as we know it, fits within the Kuhnian framework for a paradigm.
          The implication is that a new paradigm will, ultimately, supplant the
          Web as our shared medium of digital information exchange.

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas Kuhn induced a paradigm shift with his seminal book,
          <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>. In particular, this
          shift occurred in the ways we collectively view the process of
          discovery: the manner in which new ideas are conceived and
          subsequently refined. Kuhn’s work was focused on the natural sciences,
          specifically physics. However, the reach of Kuhn’s work extends to
          many other domains. Scholars in mathematics and linguistics, for
          example, have employed Kuhn’s framework to understand the development
          of their own fields. In addition, the notion of a “paradigm shift”
          permeates popular culture, particularly among entrepreneurs and
          corporations purporting to offer groundbreaking new products.
        </p>
        <p>
          One technology of world-changing consequence was the World Wide Web
          (WWW, or just, the Web). Invented and implemented by Sir Tim
          Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, the Web is the mechanism by which we
          access information online. It is a service, much like email or Usenet,
          that sits on top of the Internet. Many people forget that the Web was
          an invented technology that followed the internet, and that it has an
          idiosyncratic history worthy of study. What, though, is the best
          framework by which to analyze the technical development of the Web?
          What about its broader impact on technology and society? Many people,
          and especially technologists, view the Web as an unchanging and
          amorphous medium for information. But the Web is not without its
          problems, many of which are becoming more pronounced in our
          increasingly-digitized era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Newtonian or Einsteinian mechanics in physics, the World Wide
          Web, and particularly its utility to humans, can be understood as a
          paradigm. By analyzing the Web’s structure from this perspective, I
          will argue that we can collectively escape from its limitations --
          and, consequently, reimagine the possibilities for information
          exchange.
        </p>
        <h2 id="thestructureoftheweb">The Structure of the Web</h2>
        <p>
          What follows in this section is a fitting of the Web -- its
          development and its impacts -- into the Kuhnian philosophy of science.
          There is certainly not a one-to-one correspondence, but nevertheless,
          many of Kuhn’s most famous ideas -- namely, the pre-paradigm period
          and schools, normal science, anomaly, and crisis -- apply surprisingly
          well. The main implication of understanding the Web from this
          perspective, as we will detail in Section III, is a reframing: the
          Web, although the first mainstream mechanism for digital information
          access, does not necessarily prefigure our information future.
        </p>

          Pre-Paradigm Period and Schools
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the decades leading up to the Web’s inception, there was increasing
          awareness about the opportunities in information science presented by
          computers. Moore’s Law, formulated in 1965, stated that the number of
          transistors in an integrated circuit would double roughly every two
          years; in other words, computing power and storage capacity was
          exponentially increasing. However, there was a commensurate number of
          ideas about what the tools for information access ought to look like.
          I will discuss two of the main projects pegged, in different ways, as
          alternatives to the World Wide Web: Project Xanadu and the Gopher
          Project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arguably the underlying technology of the Web is known as
          <em>hypertext</em>: text that embeds references (hyperlinks) to other
          text. The idea for hypertext, though, actually comes from Ted Nelson,
          the founder of Project Xanadu. Nelson saw physical paper as a
          suffocating, dimension-bound, and single-sequence object. Computers,
          on the other hand, could be used to parallelize reading/writing and
          clearly display the interconnections between documents. Although the
          World Wide Web relies on Nelson’s concept of a hyperlink, it leaves
          out the visible bridges between linked documents, and there is
          certainly no built-in notion of parallelism. Project Xanadu, despite
          being officially founded in 1960, did not produce a working prototype
          until 1998 -- several years after the Web’s founding and subsequent
          growth. To this day, Nelson continues work on “The Original Hypertext
          Project”, and even states on his project’s homepage: “The computer
          world is not just technicality and razzle-dazzle. It is a continual
          war over software politics and paradigms. With ideas which are still
          radical, WE FIGHT ON” (Project Xanadu).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gopher Project, born at the University of Minnesota and bearing
          the same name as its mascot, was a much more practical Web alternative
          than Project Xanadu. The Gopher system had a number of key features,
          some of which even influenced the Web: file-like hierarchical
          management, more rigid document structure (in contrast to the relative
          free-formness of HTML in the Web), and file system tools like search
          engines (Kirscht). One of its most important elements is simplicity:
          because it doesn’t have focus on page styling or commercialization,
          information is presented in a more straightforward way than most
          modern websites. Despite its benefits, the popularity of the Mosaic
          web browser, which targeted web technologies, and Minnesota’s
          introduction of licensing fees for the Gopher software made the Web a
          more attractive option for most computer users. Still, it is important
          to note that some technology hobbyists still make scant use of the
          Gopher project today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sum, before the widespread adoption of the Web in the mid-1990s,
          the ecosystem for digital information tooling was vibrant and diverse.
          This system closely resembles, in my view, the pre-paradigm eras for
          many of the major natural sciences. As we all know, the Web won out,
          and most technologists, especially those younger, have little
          knowledge of the historical development of the platform -- the Web --
          in which most software is built on top of. Still, there is an
          additional similarity between the Web and natural science pre-paradigm
          eras that cannot be ignored. Ted Nelson continues to fight for the
          “radical” future that he envisioned back in 1960. Now in his 80s,
          Nelson bears striking similarities to the older natural scientists
          who, Kuhn writes, never fully accept a new paradigm.
        </p>
        <h3 id="normalscience">Normal Science</h3>
        <p>
          The original goal of the Web was to connect people and information. In
          the decades following the Web’s inception, many efforts have been
          undertaken to advance this goal. These developments are analogous to
          normal science, in that they match facts with and aim to refine the
          existing paradigm (namely, the Web). To illustrate this, I will trace
          a brief history of the Web post-1990, touching particularly on the
          popular -- and unofficial -- terms “Web 1.0”, “Web 2.0”, and “Web
          3.0.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>“Web 1.0”</strong> was the retronym applied to the first era
          of the World Wide Web. Arguably, this version of the Web was the most
          simple: webpages were static, content was provided from a server’s
          filesystem (as opposed to a database), and users were passive
          consumers of websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the Web as burgeoning technology, developers from the
          University of Illinois sought to make information on the Web more
          accessible. The result was Netscape, the company, and Netscape
          Navigator: a web browser with a focus on user-friendly design. Until
          1994, when Netscape released its browser, early web-surfing
          applications were notoriously dull, devoid of multimedia and color.
          Navigator, on the other hand, supported video clips, sound, forms, and
          bookmarks -- this diverse set of features made it the standout among
          early browsers and, at large, greatly accelerated the Web’s growth
          (Blitz).
        </p>
        <p>
          As an agent of the Web’s larger mission, Navigator was highly
          successful. In particular, it seemed to move the Web much closer to
          actualizing its goal of being accessible: without an elegant and
          featureful web browser, it is likely that the World Wide Web wouldn’t
          have been widely adopted by non-technologists. Although Navigator was
          superseded by Internet Explorer and, later, Google, it had a decidedly
          positive impact on the Web’s accessibility. In the Kuhnian sense,
          Navigator represents a perfect example of matching facts -- modern
          technologies -- with theory -- the Web’s goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term <strong>“Web 2.0”</strong> was coined in 1999 by Darcy
          DiNucci, and tacitly defined the “Web 1.0” just discussed. This new
          era in the Web’s history was marked by tremendous advances in
          interactivity; that is, the ability of users to create and consume web
          content dynamically. Some of the features of Web 2.0 include
          user-generated content; APIs to automated usage of websites by, for
          example, other applications; and rich user experiences enabled by new
          web technologies like JavaScript, Ajax, and Adobe Flash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The essential attribute of Web 2.0, and arguably that which we most
          associate with the Web now, is user participation. Facebook, despite
          its modern controversies, embodies this characteristic better than
          nearly any other piece of software. As noted above, Web 1.0 was
          designed to facilitate user consumption of online information --
          websites, web browsers, and web technologies were all tailored to
          satisfy this need. Sites like Facebook, however, reimagined the
          possibilities of the Web, and specifically, the user’s relationship
          with information. They saw the real potential of the Web as a
          connector: not just of people to information or information to
          information, via websites and hyperlinks, respectively, but of people
          to people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facebook, and related services, represent an articulation of the Web’s
          paradigm. The minds behind this wave of software extended what the Web
          was capable of, technologically and ideologically, but they did not
          altogether supplant the Web (which would have constituted a paradigm
          shift). Web 2.0, in my view, is aptly named even if it is an informal
          designation: nothing about the concept of the Web fundamentally
          changed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="anomaly">Anomaly</h3>
        <p>
          As Web 2.0 progressed, a fundamental problem was identified: to take
          full advantage of the Web, users had to give up their data. Moreover,
          their data was often owned by several different service providers; a
          typical user may, for instance, give substantial personal information
          to Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn. From the perspective of the Web as
          a paradigm, data privacy was a veritable anomaly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific features of <strong>“Web 3.0”</strong> are not as clearly
          defined as its 1.0 and 2.0 predecessors, in large part because it
          doesn’t exist yet. However, Tim Berners-Lee, the Web’s inventor, has
          been working to resolve the aforementioned anomaly and consequently
          bring about a new web. As he puts it, Web 3.0 will be defined by
          people having complete ownership over their data, rather than
          corporations. He plans to get us there via the Solid project and
          Inrupt, the company leading its development.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand Solid, we must briefly touch on a core technology of the
          Web: the client-server model, wherein a client (user) sends and
          receives data from the server (company, like Facebook). Typically,
          when a user creates an account, their data will be permanently stored
          “server-side”. As we’ve discussed, this is especially problematic when
          you are interacting with multiple servers, since each additional copy
          of your data further impinges on your privacy. This model also makes
          it more likely that your data could be stolen, since any of these
          servers could theoretically be breached.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea behind the Solid project is a decentralized data store,
          called a Pod. As described on Solid’s website, Pods are like “secure
          personal web servers for data.” Through their Pod, people can specify
          which applications can access their data, and can grant or revoke
          access at any time. The business model for Inrupt, Berners-Lee’s
          company, is to manage user Pods by simplifying the sign-up process and
          abstracting the technical details of running a Pod. Though there is
          the option to self-host -- that is, to set up one’s own Pod on a
          personal computer or cloud server -- this option is likely infeasible
          for any non-technical person (Solid Project).
        </p>
        <h3 id="crisis">Crisis</h3>
        <p>
          In my view, Solid and Inrupt is Berners-Lee’s attempt to resolve the
          privacy anomaly. This makes sense, because Berners-Lee is unable to
          envision alternatives to the Web itself. He is making, more or less,
          an ad-hoc modification to the paradigm -- namely, that a user’s data
          should not be provided and should instead be <em>licensed</em>.
          However, Solid and Inrupt, as currently designed, is likely to fail in
          this goal. By requiring users to store their data in a company-hosted
          Pod, user privacy is still at risk, albeit on less fronts. More
          pernicious, though, is the fact that even in Web 3.0, corporations
          will still run applications to which users will connect for service.
          Web usage will therefore continue to involve fundamentally-unwanted
          third-parties. Undoubtedly, the Web and its community are in crisis.
        </p>
        <h2 id="theresolutionofcrisis">The Resolution of Crisis</h2>
        <p>
          As Kuhn describes in <em>Structure</em>, a key sign of crisis is when
          the field’s eminent authorities begin to take notice of an anomaly
          (Kuhn, 67). Berners-Lee’s work on Solid has shown this to already be
          the case: he is desperately trying to resolve the Web’s inherent data
          privacy issues. However, as crisis goes, his work is likely to, at the
          very best, become a band-aid fix -- patchwork solutions can only go so
          far.
        </p>
        <p>
          What our information age needs is a new paradigm, a new theory of
          information access and exchange. And there is at least one, that I can
          identify, which seems to have massive potential: Urbit. In its own
          words, Urbit is a “peer-to-peer internet being built from scratch to
          be more private, secure, and durable than the current internet.” Let’s
          analyze what exactly that means against the backdrop of the modern web
          (Urbit).
        </p>
        <p>
          First, some terminology for the following paragraphs: Urbit is the
          name of the project, for which we just gave a high-level definition.
          In addition, “an Urbit” is an informal way to reference a personal
          server connected to the Urbit network. This will make more sense in a
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>Key features of the Urbit stack:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A personal server</strong>: As we mentioned earlier, so much
            of our data and the application code that utilizes that data is run
            “server-side.” This is because, for most normal people, running your
            own Unix server would be much too complicated. Of course, the
            problem is that by deferring the computation to corporate servers,
            we lose control over our data. The solution? Give everyone an Urbit:
            a <em>personal</em> server that stores data, performs computation,
            connects to the Internet, and much, much more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A peer-to-peer network</strong>: In order to message to a
            friend over a service like iMessage or WhatsApp, your message is
            first sent to a corporate server, processed, (potentially) sent to a
            different server, then delivered to your friend. In a peer-to-peer
            network, there is one step: the message from your computer gets sent
            <em>directly</em> to your friend’s computer. This is the exact
            “networking model that Urbit offers (just replace “computer” in the
            previous sentence with “Urbit”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Other features include a built-in reputation system to fight
            scammers, a decentralized identity system, and a functional
            operating system, but these are less important to Urbit as a strict
            web replacement. (Newton)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To many technologists, the ideas of Urbit seem radical. And indeed,
          for these people, they are. As Kuhn would put it, the ideas propounded
          by the Urbit project are incommensurable with those of our
          web-dominated world. But the unique nature of paradigms is that they
          will ultimately be replaced. Urbit exists as one such replacement, but
          there will certainly be others.
        </p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Conceiving of the Web as a paradigm would seem to violate the very
          notion of technological advance. After all, many would say we live in
          a world whose technology has built upon its predecessors in a
          perfectly explainable, linear fashion. However, I contend that
          technological advance is unrelated to the central question of how we,
          as humans, use our tools. Technology has paradigms in the same way
          that natural science has paradigms: instead of trying to explain
          nature, as the sciences do, technology instead tries to improve
          humankind’s relationship to nature (and, by extension, to one
          another). When our tools are no longer serving our needs, we replace
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shifting away from the Web paradigm is not to abandon the Web: core
          technologies like hyperlinks, multi-way communication, search, and
          browsers will continue to influence future tools and ideas for
          information exchange, much as they have done in the Urbit project.
          Rather, this shift is about digital agency: how we recapture it, and
