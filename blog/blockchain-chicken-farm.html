          >. My expectations for the book were set by its title: stories of
          technology applications — and impacts — in rural China. And to a large
          extent, the book met these expectations. Wang wrote dutifully about
          their subjects and the regions they dwell in; the technologies
          documented throughout the book were diverse; and Wang generally
          provided history when necessary, allowing me to connect the dots
          between China’s many rural policy programs and the consequent rise in
          rural technology adoption.

          At times, I felt that Wang leaned too heavily into the social sciences
          and their subjective experience, leaning <em>away</em> from the
          stories in the process. There is one example that, I think, captures
          this pattern well.
        </p>
        <p>
          During their chapter on blockchain chicken farming, Wang recalls
          attending the Decentralized Web Summit and hearing a talk by the
          founder of
          <a href="https://lightning.network/#intro">Lightning Network</a>, a
          Bitcoin protocol. Relying on a quote from the talk, they paint a
          picture of interest in blockchain technology as being motivated by a
          “cynical view of human nature.” To illustrate this point further, they
          allege that blockchain enthusiasts cite the “tragedy of the commons”
          theory often, but that this “concept” “was disproved with in-depth
          data and careful science.” This argument — and especially their
          paragraph on the tragedy of the commons — felt forced and overall
          distracting from the main goal of the chapter: to look at how rural
          farmers and wealthy Chinese urbanites are using blockchain technology
          to track the lifecycle of chickens (and opening up unique
          opportunities for digitally-verifiable food safety).
        </p>

          A number of other sections in the book followed a similar format, with
          the stories weaving in and out with Wang’s highly-personal beliefs on
          various social issues. This recurring discursiveness is my primary
          critique of
          <em>Blockchain Chicken Farm</em>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
        <p>
          All that said, the storytelling aspects of the book were incredibly
          effective and informative. Each chapter had a new story that I
          otherwise may have never learned about; new people, technology,
          regions of China, specific social impacts. Some of these include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Using technology to monitor the welfare of pigs.</em> Rising
            income levels across China have led to dramatic increases in
            national pork consumption. As a result, the risk of disease —
            especially the deadly African Swine Flu (ASF) — has risen. One way
            that farms are trying to combat this is using surveillance
            technology and artificial intelligence. Alibaba, a major Chinese
            internet and e-commerce company, is building ET Agricultural Brain,
            a massive AI model to monitor pigs for signs of disease by ingesting
            video, temperature, and sound data.

              bracelet donning a QR code.</em
            >
            Scanning the code takes you to a page containing surveillance
            footage of the chicken; you can also find maps showing its lifetime
            movements. These chickens are also tested every two weeks for
            antibiotic usage, data from which is digitized and accessible. These
            chickens fetch a high price in the market: wealthy buyers appreciate
            — and are willing to pay a premium for — the data on their chickens.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Lastly, what struck me was how integral e-commerce operations are
          becoming to the economies of rural areas of China — and how
          co-dependent some rural Americans are on their Chinese counterparts.
          In the last chapter, Wang describes how the very same pearls that
          sustain the e-commerce operations of a small town in China might power
          some
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing"
            >multi-level marketing</a
          >
          (MLM) pearl schemes across rural America. I’m left thinking about how
          the evolving economies and technology adoption of both rural America
          and rural China are strikingly similar -- and inter-connected.
