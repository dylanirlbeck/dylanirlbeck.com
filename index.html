        <p>Hi, I'm Dylan.</p>
        <p>
          I'm currently a software engineer at
          <a href="https://flexport.com">Flexport</a>, where I'm helping to
          build the operating system for global trade (I work specifically in
          the
          <a href="https://www.flexport.com/glossary/consolidation/"
            >consolidations</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://www.flexport.com/glossary/container-freight-station/"
            >warehousing</a
          >
          domains). I'm also a proud alumni and recent graduate of the
          <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/"
            >University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          When able, I spend time <a href="/writing.html">thinking</a> about how
          to construct robust, maintainable, and equitable digital systems. From
          an engineering perspective, I'm presently interested in how to combine
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"
            >domain-driven design</a
          >
          and functional programming to build the "right" software. At the same
          time, I'm trying to explore where so many of our current digital
          systems went wrong (particularly via more focus on computing ethics),
          and how to avoid those same pitfalls in my work. Finally, I'm very
          interested in government and civic technology as avenues to build
          truly impactful software: if you're doing work in these fields and see
          an opportunity to collaborate with me,
