          In a dual order of recency and preference, here are all the books I've
          read or am currently reading. Within each year, I present the books by
          the rough order in which I most enjoyed them. You'll notice that there
          are a substantial number of books in 2021: this is when I'm starting
          off my record, so the books listed there could have been read anytime
          up to and including that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          When linking to a book, I attempt to avoid any particular seller
          (especially Amazon). If this isn't feasible, I'll default to an
          independent bookseller or no link at all. In addition, I try to
          reflect -- in varying degrees of detail -- on every book I read. I
          link to these reflections when they're available.
