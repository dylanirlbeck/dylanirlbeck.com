        I'm currently reading the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idea_Factory"
          >Idea Factory</a
        >
        -- a book about the history of Bell Labs -- to learn more about
        "innovation." In the abstract, I want to study the specific conditions
        that beget creative thinking. More concretely, I want to come away from
        the book with a strong understanding of the history of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistor</a>, the
        particular innovation that created my job and, unsurprisingly, was
        discovered first at the Labs.

        This page is a WIP -- I hope to build it out to encompass my entire
        bookshelf, along with any book reviews.
